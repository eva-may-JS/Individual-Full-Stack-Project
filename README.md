Coven Connect is a social networking site tailored for magical practitioners. From spellcasters to potion makers, this platform provides a space for connecting through events, sharing wisdom, and forming lifelong friendships.

## UX/UI

The goals of this project are:

- An accesible website which clearly states and is oriented toward the intended audience (magical practicioners)
- A place for users to browse events they may be interested in attending, and find out the relevant details
- A place where users can interact and let others know they plan on attending an event in the coments section
- (A page where users can create and showcase their own events for others to attend)

To this end, 

The following is a wireframe of how the page is planned to look on a mobile:

The project may deviate from this wireframe due to potential design improvements during the process
