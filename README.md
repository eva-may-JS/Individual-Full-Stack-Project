### Features Left to Implement

- Create new pages within the website which currently display as "Under Development"
- Create clickable images in the Further Information section with the recommended websites' logos to make this section stand out more

## Testing 

This project was tested using DevTools on the deployed product. All links and buttons have been checked and are clickable and functional and the layout has been inspected and found satisfactory on all screen sizes using the "Responsive" Dimentions option and dragging the viewport to all possible and reasonable shapes and sizes.

The code was also checked using HTML and CSS validation systems.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - Three errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
    - Missing alt attribute on logo image (Fixed)
    - White space in an ID value field (Fixed)
    - Use of "hr" inside lists (Unfixed)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

Testing revealed incorrect use of "hr" element. A suitable alternative to create the desired effect is yet to be implemented.

## Deployment

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
